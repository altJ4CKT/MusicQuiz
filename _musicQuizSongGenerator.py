class Generator:

    """
    A class to manage and interact with a music database, performing operations such as adding artists, albums, songs,
    authors, and packs. It provides methods for inserting data into the database, creating necessary relationships 
    between entities, and generating required database tables if they do not already exist.

    The following tables are managed by this class:
    
    - **ArtistData**: Stores artist information.
    - **AlbumData**: Stores album information.
    - **SongData**: Stores song details, including album association and lyrics.
    - **ArtistSongLink**: Establishes a many-to-many relationship between artists and songs.
    - **AuthorData**: Stores information about authors.
    - **PackData**: Represents song packs, linked to authors.
    - **PackSongLink**: Links songs to packs with lyric position details.

    This class assumes that the underlying database is an SQLite database, and it performs SQL queries to interact 
    with the database.

        - **PackSongLink**: Links songs to packs with lyric position details.
